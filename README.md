# SSFMobile

The official mobile app of summitstreetfitness.org  

The app breaks down fitness into two components: Training and Recovery

Training:

This app allows users to build and track their workouts with the concept of periodization. Periodization breaks down your workout scheduel as follows:

Macrocycle > Mesocycle > Microcycle > Days

Recovery:

How you spend your time recovering from your workouts is just as important as the workouts. At the moment we offer two features

1: Calorie tracker, this lets you log meals and track macros 

2: Sleep tracker, this helps you bugdet out enough time to sleep each night and tells you how much sleep you need each night

To run this code you must install all dependencies then open the command line and run 
$Expo Start
This will show you what the app looks like on your phone with the Expo Go mobile app
